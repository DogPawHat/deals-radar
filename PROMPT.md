study @SPEC.md
study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and pick the most important task to do

IMPORTANT:

- If you find a task that you picked is already done, mark it as done in the IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md file and finish up.
- do not pick up a task that is blocked by dependencies
- when doing frontend work changing the design, use the agent-browser skill to verify the changes. CRITICAL:
  - save screenshot from agent browser in ./.agent-browser/tmp/screenshots/. DO NOT save screenshots outside this repo and DO NOT use the screenshot command without specifying the path.
- make a commit when you complete a task. if you are blocked by the pre-commit hooks, you need to make them pass before committing.
