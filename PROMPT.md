study @SPEC.md
study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and pick the most important task to do that's not blocked by dependencies

IMPORTANT:

- If you find a task that you picked is already done, mark it as done in the IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md file and finish up.
- make a commit when you complete a task. if you are blocked by the pre-commit hooks, you need to make them pass before committing.
