Components in `src/components/ui` are sourced from the shadcn/ui registry.
Use the shadcn mcp to list components you might need and install new ones.
Once a component is installed, you can edit it to fit the style and functionality of the application.
Do not write components in `src/components/ui` unless they are part of the shadcn/ui registry.
